## Important Notes
- We'll use [Sentry Releases](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/releases/) to ship better code
- We'll use [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) so we'll not intersect between developers
- We'll use PR for pushing your code into master and I'll be a reviewer
- We'll use [bin-flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)
- For making react components ready for cross-projects we'll use [Bit](https://bitsrc.io/).
- We'll use [Jest + Enzyme for tests](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- We'll use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) in order to have ability review our pages online
- We'll use [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) for setting up tests coverage
- Send API calls to server. @TODO share with team an API endpoints. for making calls use Axious.
- For subscription service we'll use [Paddle.js](https://paddle.com/docs/paddle-js-overlay-checkout/)

- Each component should looks simple and understandable
- We should use [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) components for faster development process
- You should create and maintain documentation [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)
